<a id="welcome-to-my-main-plugins-website" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-main-plugins-website" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome To My Main Plugins Website!</h1>

<p>This site is basically just a simple overview of all my plugins and their features, and where you can find stable releases and where you can find untested beta releases. All the plugins here are designed to work with ImagicalMine, the server software that is truly imagical, although most will work with PocketMine as well.</p>

<a id="boxofbits" class="anchor" href="#boxofbits" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>BoxOfBits</h2>

<p>BoxOfBits is my main plugin plugin with the most features, currently still in 0.0.1 but 1.0.0 is scheduled for March. It has gamemode, rules, xyz, help/info, custom messages and popups. You can find it on these websites:</p>

<a id="staffchests" class="anchor" href="#staffchests" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>StaffChests</h2>

<p>StaffChests is a plugin I started lately with 2 main features. Mainly what it does is on the plugins main command it will give you two options, key or chest. Once you place the chest down it is unopenable unless you are holding the key as you open it, the chest also comes with a little surprise inside..... This is only for server staff to use but the other feature is another command that anyone can run which gives them a chest, when they place down and open this there is another chest inside, and so on and so on, it goes on for quite a while :P. This plugin is still under development and as such no download is available yet.</p>

<h2>
<a id="rulekit" class="anchor" href="#rulekit" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RuleKit</h2>

<p>RuleKit is a minor plugin I started a while ago, it currently has no stable version or download. It is just a really simple rules plugin, with /rules showing the server rules that can be set in the config, similar to xRulesx or CommandRules, which are other plugins with the same feature.</p>
